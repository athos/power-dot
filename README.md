A PoC library for Clojure that helps you make friends with Java's functional interfaces

## Example

```clojure
(require '[power-dot.core :as dot])
(import '[java.util.stream IntStream])

(dot/. (IntStream/range 0 10) (forEach (fn [x] (println x))))
;; 0
;; 1
;; 2
;; 3
;; 4
;; 5
;; 6
;; 7
;; 8
;; 9
;=> nil

(dot/.. (IntStream/range 0 10)
        (filter #(= (mod % 3) 0))
        (forEach println))
;; 0
;; 3
;; 6
;; 9
;=> nil

(letfn [(fib [n]
          (if (<= n 1)
            n
            (+ (fib (- n 1)) (fib (- n 2)))))]
  (dot/.. (IntStream/range 0 10)
          (map fib)
          (forEach println)))
;; 0
